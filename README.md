Bugs for fixing in Phase 2:

    The menu for adding foods to a log entry can repeat prompts
    Menu formatting

Future Implementations for Phase 2:

    Additional delete capabilities
    Checking food & recipe names uniqueness
    Adding event listeners to view (corresponds with GUI)
    Automatic saving abilities for abrupt user exits (only explicit save currently)
    Add default weight / reuse most recent weight
    Add default calories / reuse most recent calories
    When a user logs, a different date (besides default) should be able to be selected
    Ability to view specific log dates and date spans

Instructions for Running the Application:

    The main method is located in the WellnessManager class
    Menus are provided via a command line interface to the user and are self explanatory for possible functionality
    Prompts display based on the userâ€™s selection to collect user input needed for various functionalities
